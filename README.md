IMAGE, similar to the 'react' framework, manipulates a virtual document object model (VDOM) which yeilds a significant performance increase compared to writing repeatedly to the DOM. For instance, in previous iterations of IMAGE, a scene with 300 canvas objects would need to make 300 costly DOM manipulations, leading to sub-30 frame rates, which is the minimum to meet acceptance critera. With the new VDOM approach, 300 non-costly manipulations to the VDOM are needed and are followed by a single costly DOM manipulation, yeilding frame rates of 50 and above. Drawing performance is limited only by pure javascript capabilites and not by calls to the DOM.
