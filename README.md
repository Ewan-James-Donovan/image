<b>IMAGE</b> is used to simplify the dynamic creation of SVG elements inside an SVG tag on a web page while providing useful constructs for mathematical drawings. It currently facilitates the configuraton, drawing, animation, and styling of:

## Getting Started - TBD<a name="Getting-Started"></a>

To get started using IMAGE, download this repository and place the folder somewhere on your server.
After that, create a new javascript file and add the line below to it. This new file is which is where you'll configure your drawing.

```javascript
import Image from "path/to/Image.js";
```
Next, you need to include this new file as a module script on the page you desire to render drawings on.
Place the code below just before the closing body tag on your desired page.

```html
<script type="module" src="path/to/your/file.js"></script>
```
For each canvas you make, you will need to create and instance of the imported IMAGE class. In your javascript file, include the line below.
```javascript
let img = new Image();
```

Initialising a canvas is simple. First, create a div element in your desired HTML file and give it a unique id.

```html
<div id="unique-id"></div>
```

Now, in your javascript file, simply include the following line, swapping out width, height, unique-id, and cssColor appropriately. The colour can be changed to any valid CSS colour. Width and height must use valid CSS units.

```javascript
img.createCanvas("unique-id", "width", "height", "cssColor");
```

IMAGE, similar to the 'react' framework, manipulates a virtual document object model (VDOM) which yeilds a significant performance increase compared to writing repeatedly to the DOM. For instance, in previous iterations of IMAGE, a scene with 300 canvas objects would need to make 300 costly DOM manipulations, leading to sub-30 frame rates, which is the minimum to meet acceptance criteria. With the new VDOM approach, 300 non-costly manipulations to the VDOM are needed and are followed by a single costly DOM manipulation, yeilding frame rates of 50 and above. Drawing performance is limited only by pure javascript capabilites and not by calls to the DOM.
